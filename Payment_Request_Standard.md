## 1 Introduction
Payment Request is a file, which requests a payment to be made. The Payment Request file contains details like amount to pay, the intended receiver of the payment, and any conditions for the payment.

Payment Request can be created in several ways; by using a Payment App that sends the request into the API, or it can be created at the webshops to request payments for the purchase of items, or it can be generated automatically by servers as a part of subscription service.
