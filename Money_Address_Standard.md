# Money Address Standard version 0.0.1


## 1 Introduction
Money Address is conceptually like an e-mail address. The difference is this address is used for sending money. The Money Address has mostly the same format as an e-mail address.

The Money Address can be considered as a universal bank account system. The human-readable account address will make it easy to send money to any person at any Bitcoin Bank.

When sending a Bitcoin Cheque to another person, that person can be addressed by using his Money Address. The cheque will then be sent to the Money Account API, as pointed to by the chequeâ€™s address.
